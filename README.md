This project contains the code for a logs analyzer I'm building for my job as a Technical Support Engineer. We receive numerous log files a day which frequently contain thousands of lines of code in each file. We get by with the search functionality of whichever code editor/viewer we use and can search for and filter the logs by searching for key words, but I thought it would be great to use my coding skills to build a utility that will give us a breakdown of relevant information at a glance.

## Phase One
Phase One is proof of concept and establishing the base functionality. 

The script currently executes from and displays results in the command line.

## Phase Two
* Formatted text / color coded
* List integrations used by customer (Jordan's idea from Berlin meeting)
* Make analytics parameters adjustible/customizable.
* Write results to file
* Scan multiple files

## Phase Three
* Graphical interface
* Deploy to web-based interface
